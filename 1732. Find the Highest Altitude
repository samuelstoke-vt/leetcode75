EASY

Description:
There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal 0.

You are given an integer array gain of length n where gain[i] is the net gain in altitude between points i​​​​​​ and i + 1 for all (0 <= i < n). Return the highest altitude of a point.

Solution:
Have a running value for current height and update a max height. Return the max height.

class Solution {
public:
    int largestAltitude(vector<int>& gain) {
        int max = 0;
        int curr = 0;

        for(int i=0; i<gain.size();i++)
        {
            curr += gain[i];

            if(curr > max)
            {
                max = curr;
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
};

EASY

Description:
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

-1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
Return the number that I picked.


Solution:
This is just a binary search.
/** 
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * @param  num   your guess
 * @return 	     -1 if num is higher than the picked number
 *			      1 if num is lower than the picked number
 *               otherwise return 0
 * int guess(int num);

    int guessNumber(int n) {


        int min = 0;
        int max = n;
        int g = min+(max-min)/2;
        int val = guess(g);

        while (val != 0)
        {
            if (val == -1)
            {
                max = g-1;
            }
            else
            {
                min = g+1;
            }
            g = min+(max-min)/2;
            val = guess(g);
        }

        return g;
    }

Description:
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the array.

Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Can you solve it without sorting?


Solution:
Just use a heap and remove k-1 elements then return the top. TBH... not the best solution. I'm not sure how to add things and keep them in order however, so I sorted. It's not much slower, though.

class Solution {
public:
    int findKthLargest(vector<int>& nums, int k) {

        make_heap(nums.begin(),nums.end());

        while(!nums.empty() && k>1)
        {
            pop_heap(nums.begin(),nums.end());
            nums.pop_back();
            k--;
        }
        return nums[0];
        
    }
};

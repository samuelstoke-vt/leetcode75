Description:
The Tribonacci sequence Tn is defined as follows: 

T0 = 0, T1 = 1, T2 = 1, and Tn+3 = Tn + Tn+1 + Tn+2 for n >= 0.

Given n, return the value of Tn.


Solution:
We are given the max n, so we can make a vector size n+1 and fill it inductively.

class Solution {
public:
    int tribonacci(int n) {

        vector<int> trib(39);
        trib[0] = 0;
        trib[1] = 1;
        trib[2] = 1;

        for(int i = 3;i<=n;i++)
        {
            trib[i] = trib[i-3]+trib[i-2]+trib[i-1];
        }
        return trib[n];


        
    }
};

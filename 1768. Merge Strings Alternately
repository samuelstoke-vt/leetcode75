EASY

Description:
You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. 
If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.


Solution:

Pretty easy. Use a for loop to add the characters of these strings iteratively. Make sure none go out of bounds. Return the string when the loop terminates.
